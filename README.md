False Data Injection Attack: 
False Data Injection encompasses a class of malicious data attacks that 
target critical infrastructures controlled by Cyber-Physical Information 
Systems. FDIA strategies involve the attacker compromising sensor 
readings, so undetected corrupt data is included in calculating values and 
variables used to define the system state.
Attacks in power systems running on smart grids result in the loss of 
management for control devices, resulting in operational overheads and severe 
power outages. Successful, false data injection attacks also result in the 
corruption of transactions on power systems, leading to revenue loss. By 
acquiring knowledge of the circuit fault condition, FDIA attacks also lead to 
load distribution dysfunction that causes intermittent faults and power 
imbalance between demand and supply. 
Wireless IoT device communication has found favorable adoption in major 
industries, such as air travel, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. In such 
instances, false data injection vulnerabilities introduce the risk of privacy 
leakage, as these devices mostly process sensitive, personally identifying 
information. Successful data injection into these systems often results in 
computational overhead as unknown elements complicate the mathematical 
model used in decision-making based on IoT sensor input. 
Attackers also target injection vulnerabilities in communication networks to 
alter data transmitted within the control device to hybrid IoT networks. A 
successful attack’s severity depends on the injection attack type, the target 
system, and the deviation between original measurements and the altered data 
set.
Examples of FDIA attacks: 
False Data Injection Attacks are categorized according to the subsystem 
affected and the level of access the attacker can obtain. The following 
section highlights the common forms of FDIA attacks and recently 
orchestrated real-world exploits as examples. 
Types of FDIA attacks: 
Depending on the level of access adversaries possess to the power systems, 
FDIA attacks can be classified into: 
Internal attacks
This form of FDIA attack is carried out by those adversaries who possess 
precise knowledge of the system’s bilinear pairing operations. An attacker also 
accurately understands the power system’s network topology, capacity, cost 
function, and standard measurements of the target system. In most cases, the 
adversary is an internal threat, such as a disgruntled employee or a malicious 
actor. He can access the power system’s historical load data and control 
devices. 
External attacks
Adversaries carry out this False Data Injection attack with incomplete 
information about the power network. As a result, the attacker relies on 
weaknesses in the physical network’s security model to eavesdrop, replay and 
inject false data into the smart grid. One common approach to effecting such 
attacks is to target vulnerabilities in input validation and transport layer 
security for delivering false data through techniques such as code 
injection and cross-site request forgery.
